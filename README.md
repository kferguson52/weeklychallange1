# Weekly Challenge 1

Hey guys! This is my first challenge as it relates to my full stack class.

## Description

This challenge involved refactoring the HTML to contain semantic elements. Additionally, we refactored the CSS code that contained a lot of repetive code. 
I was able to reduce the CSS file by about 30% by making the code more effecient.
